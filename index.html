            <h2>Ollie-Bear at 10 Months</h2>
            <img src="bear-ball.jpg" alt="Bouvier Des Flanders Fawn Puppy" id="bear">
            <p>Ollie-Bear is approaching his ten month birth day, and he weighs in at about 95 pounds. His obedience is coming along, he walks nicely on leash. He knows sit and down, but could use more work on the recall. </p>
            <p>The biggest behavior issues with Ollie are that he has discovered that he can stand on his hind legs and shop the kitchen counter. He also can reach into the sink and pull out dishes, so everyone is supposed to rinse their dishes and put them directly into the dishwasher. He also still has a thing for stealing shoes.</p>
            <p>Ollie has started sleeping out of his cage in the bedroom most nights. It is critical to puppy proof the room if you are going to try doing this with your puppy.</p>

            <h2>Month 10: Adolescence</h2>
            <h3>Sexual Maturity</h3>
            <p>If they haven't already, your dog should be entering adolescence. What does that mean to you? If you have a female, she may have already, or be about to enter her first heat cycle. If you have a male dog, you may notice that he begins or increases marking behavior. Even though your pup is approaching adult size, they still have the brain of a puppy.</p>
            <h3>Should I Spay or Neuter my pet?</h3>

            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <img src="ender.jpg" alt="beagle mix at ten months old" class="left-image">
            <p>Though your pup is approaching adult size, they still have the brain of a puppy and should be supervised or in a cage at all times. They may continue to chew on things and get into things they shouldn't. Large dogs may now be able to reach, and steal things off of counters and tables.</p>
            <p>If you haven't already done so, now would be a good age to start your dog in a beginners obedience class. It will be a good social activity for the two of you to do together. At this point you should have your pup trained to walk nicely on leash, sit, down, and come when called. Due to their short puppy attention spans, they may not be reliable on these commands and still may need gentle reinforcement.</p>
            <p>Make sure that your dog is getting enough activity. Playing ball in a fenced yard or going for walks is a good way to keep your dog active and their brain engaged. If you have a second dog, supervised play between the two dogs can be an excellent way to keep both entertained and active. A bored dog without enough activity is more likely to get into trouble.</p>
